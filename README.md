# Responsive-Portfolio-Homework
## Description
I used Bootstrap4 to make a responsive portfolio page that can be used to display my information collect information from potential employers or potential clients. I will also update it to show off my most recent or most important projects. I created this webpage to show my understanding of bootstrap and to have a place to direct people in the future if they are looking for more information about me. I can also update it to look better or adjust things later depending on how my perspective changes or when my skills improve. I built this webpage using bootstap4's grid system of rows, and columns to flesh out my content and included a navbar and footer. I also used some media queries to adjust the size of some of the images that I used in the about me page.
